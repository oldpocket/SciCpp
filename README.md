SciCpp - Scientific Cpp Objects

SciCpp is a small framework to work with Physics Simulations. I started it around 2005/2006 during my BSc in Physics, to be used in the projects of computational physics I had at the time.

Is composed of a small physics engine, able to interate over time, using Euler or Verlet methods. Also it provides helpful classes as Vector3D and Mass.

The plan is to envolve it to produce more complex simulations, of differents physical phenomenas.
