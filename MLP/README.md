# MLP - Classification & Regression

Based on the Original: https://github.com/fbia/Regression-with-a-Multi-Layer-Perceptron

Multi Layer Perceptron - Machine learning. 
A C++ implementation of a multi layer perceptron (MLP).

The neural network can solve classification and regression tasks.

The code implements:
- MLP training with backpropagation
- Grid search for model selection
- Regularization: early stopping and weight decay

Applicable for classification and "blind" regression tasks (after trainning).

Modified by me (Fabio Godoy) to resolve a set of problems of my "Financial Engineering" MBA at USP (Sao Paulo University) between 2022 and 2023.
